# Teaching Data Science

Data Science with Python - exercises and tutorials about statistics, data handling and transformation, modelling, and machine learning models.

## Intro to Statistics

We'll use some very helpful tools from packages `scipy` and `statsmodels`, which are really great and super comprehensive for
statistics with Python.

**Nice resources to learn more:** 

* **Resampling** http://www.resample.com/intro-text-online/  This is a very complehensive book about resampling 
“Resampling: The New Statistics” by Julian L. Simon (1997)
* **Parametric vs. non-parametric models** explained super well here: http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2015/slides/ghahramani/gp-neural-nets15.pdf
* **Data distributions** very very nice discussion in this thread here: https://www.quora.com/Most-machine-learning-datasets-are-in-Gaussian-distribution-Where-can-we-find-the-dataset-which-follows-Bernoulli-Poisson-gamma-beta-etc-distribution
* **This awessome free book** Gareth James,Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani. An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R https://www.statlearning.com/
